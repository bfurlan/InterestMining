% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%\boldmath
Intelligent Question Routing Systems (IQRS) aim to serve as a knowledge exchange medium in an arbitrary field of expertise, where intensive communication between users is required (e.g., large enterprises, e-government agencies, technical support, health care system, army). Other applications can involve a support in educational and collaboration processes, where IQRS facilitates an efficient and effective knowledge exchange between scholars. The benefit coming from deployment of such systems includes: (a) reducing unnecessary “pinging” of experts, which are a valuable resource and (b) increasing the system owners' (enterprise, government, university) quality of service, since users are more satisfied with answers, because their questions are answered by the right persons. In this paper we investigate the role of semantic similarity for each stage of IQRS process. For question analysis we use semantic enrichment, more precisely semantic query expansion with ConceptNet, WordNet (Antelope), and SemNet. Also, for question routing stage we used techniques developed for semantic similarity between two paragraphs sentences.  Finally, for evaluation we used special subsets of Yahoo! L6 Answers dataset from which we extracted three different types of users:  (1) Top questioneers, (2) Top answerers, and (3) Top combination of previous user types to model interest and expertise. Over these users we build special semantic profiles and match them to questions, answers or the whole question threads, according to the specific IQRS stage.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%

%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline

%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.

\subsection{Sources}
To build efficient user profiles, we collect a lot of evidences from user's posts. We separate evidences by source, which can origin from question body, answer body, question title, whole post thread or IQRS system. We further categorize evidences by their type, which can be one  the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf ConceptNet}~\cite{bib:conceptnet} is a semantic knowledge base that describes general human knowledge. It includes words and common phrases from many written texts. They are related through open domain predicates and through common knowledge. The database was created manually and partially automatically from Wiktionary and ReVerb system, which is an open information extraction tool that extracts binary relationships of type {\it phrase-relation-phrase} in an unsupervised manner. The whole database contains 414 thousand English concepts and 903 thousand relationships between them.
	\item {\bf Semantic Network of Terms} (SemNet)~\cite{bib:semnet} is a large-scale network of technical terminology which allows querying terms and retrieving ranked lists of their semantically related terms. The network was automatically constructed based on the noun terms from English Google Books Ngram Dataset using word co-occurrence analysis. The network consists of 2.8 million distinct single and multi-word terms and 37.5 million weighted edges between them. SemNet includes a large part of the same concepts and relationships from similar semantic knowledge bases such as WordNet~\cite{bib:wordnet} and ConceptNet~\cite{bib:conceptnet}. 
	\item {\bf TF-IDF}, term frequency-inverse document frequency is a general numerical statistic that defines the importance of each word in a document collection. It is often used in information retrieval and text mining as it gives good string-based performance. 
	\item {\bf Categories} Each post contains associated categories. In our dataset there are three hierarchical category types. Their values are more thoroughly explained under the dataset description (\secref{sec:dataset}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}
\TODO write section intro


\subsection{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}
We reviewed many question answering (QA) systems and datasets. Finally, we decided to use Yahoo! Answers Webscope L6 dataset~\cite{bib:yahool6} because it contains a broad range of distinct question categories and there are enough active users in each of the categories we selected. Other acceptable datasets could be extracted from sites such as AskVille (\url{http://askville.amazon.com}), Mahalo (\url{http://mahalo.com}), Quora (\url{http://quora.com}) and StackOverflow (\url{http://stackoverflow.com}). The latter also includes a lot of users but it does not have specified specific categories and more importantly, the whole dataset is mostly single domain oriented. Furthermore, there are lots of other systems like AllExperts (\url{http://allexperts.com}), Ask.com (\url{http://ask.com}), Answers.com (\url{http://answers.com}) and others that lack one or more public features to build useful dataset.

Yahoo! Answers is a QA site where people post questions and answers, all of which is publicly available to any web user. The L6 dataset was collected from this site in 2007 and it includes all the questions (i.e. 4483032) and their corresponding answers. Next to these data some anonymized metadata is included, so that we can model concepts of post and user. 

Instances of post type represent questions and answers. Each instance consists of text in the body, selection of main category, category and subcategory and the id of the user who wrote the post. Questions additionally contain also title. For answer posts, the owner user is known only if it was considered the best answer for the question.

User instances are completely anonymized, so therefore we model them using their id and we also count how many answers or questions they posted in specific category type.

From the full dataset we extracted three database types:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Type 1}: This dataset models interest as it contains users that asked at least ten questions and each of these questions must have at least five answers.
	\item {\bf Type 2}: To model knowledge, we extracted users who best answered at least ten questions. Again, each question thread needed to have at least five answers.
	\item {\bf Type 3}: To jointly represent interest and knowledge, we extracted users that asked at least five questions and best answered at least five questions. Also, each of these threads needed to have at least five answers.
\end{itemize}
Each dataset type contains 100 users which are distinct across the datasets. As there are many different categories in the data, we representatively selected them, so that extracted 100 users within each dataset are formed as shown in \tblref{tab:datasets}.

\TODO specifics in code, evaluation setting

\subsection{Results}
\TODO

To evaluate our work we use metrics mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and Precision@N (P@N) which are widely used in the field. They are defined as follows: (1) MRR is a measure to evaluate information retrieval task in which a list of possible responses to a query is ordered by a probability of correctness. The score is defined as the average of the reciprocal ranks for a set of queries $Q$,
$$
	{\rm MRR = }\frac{1}{|Q|}\sum_{i=1}^{|Q|}\frac{1}{rank_i}.
$$
(2) Precision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to a query. P@N is therefore precision which is evaluated at a given cut-off rank $N$ (i.e. considering only top $N$ results). In our domain it measures the proportion of correctly selected experts among all experts or intuitively a probability of how likely asking one of the top $N$ will result in getting a correct answer.

Visualization:
	- ascending graphs for P@N
	- MRR table: x=db type, y=evidence types used
