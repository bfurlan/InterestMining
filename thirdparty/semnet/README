	  the data. The database has been created using the SQLite JDBC driver 3.7.2.

- Schema
	#  words(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, text TEXT, frequency INTEGER);
		- table "words" is the vocabulary of single word tokens
		- id: identifier of the vocabulary word
		- text: string of the vocabulary word
		- frequency: unigram frequency of the word
	# nouncooccurrences(termw1 INTEGER, termw2 INTEGER, termw3 INTEGER, relw1 INTEGER, relw2 INTEGER, relw3 INTEGER, relfreq REAL)
		- table "nouncooccurrences" contains the semantic graph. Each edge in
		  the graph is one row in the table. All 6 integer values are foreign
		  key relationships to the "words" table
		- termw1: first word of the term
		- termw2: second word of the term or null
		- termw3: third word of the term or null
		- relw1: first word of the related term
		- relw2: second word of the related term or null
		- relw3: third word of the related term or null
		- relfreq: relative frequency (co-occurrence probability)

- Example content of the words table:
	 id		| text		| frequency

	termw1 |termw2	| termw3| relw1	| relw2	| relw3	| relfreq

- Example queries on the database:
	# Retrieve ID for a word
		- select id from words where text = 'doctor';
	# Retrieve word for an word ID
		- select text from words where id = 5824331;
	# Retrieve first 20 rows of related term ids for a single word term ordered by descending probability
		select * from nouncooccurrences where termw1 = 5824331 and termw2 is null and termw3 is null order by relfreq desc limit 20;
	# Retrieve the 50 most related string terms with probability for a single word term ordered by descending probability
		select w1.text,w2.text,w3.text,relfreq from nouncooccurrences left join words as w1 on relw1 = w1.id left join words as w2 on relw2 = w2.id left join words as w3 on relw3 = w3.id where termw1 = 5824331 and termw2 is null and termw3 is null order by relfreq desc limit 50;
